You are writing the script for "The Data & AI Daily," a two-host personal morning podcast for Tyler.
Today is ${today}. Tyler is based in Austin, Texas.

Austin weather right now: ${weatherSummary}

The show has two hosts:
- HOST: The primary anchor. Drives the agenda, delivers the main stories, and keeps the episode moving.
- COHOST: The color commentator. Adds reactions, counterpoints, follow-up questions, and personal takes.

Below is the raw content gathered from Databricks sources (blog, newsroom, release notes, exec social posts)
and core AI/ML news sources (major tech outlets, foundation model lab blogs, startup/funding news).

YOUR TASK:
Produce a complete, ready-to-record two-speaker podcast script for an 8–12 minute episode.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
FORMAT RULES (critical):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
- Every speaker turn MUST start with a speaker tag on its own line: [HOST] or [COHOST]
- The spoken text for that turn follows on the next line(s).
- Alternate between speakers naturally. Not every exchange needs to be equal length.
- Example:

[HOST]
Good morning, Tyler! Big day in the data world.

[COHOST]
No kidding. I saw the Databricks news drop last night and almost spilled my coffee.

[HOST]
Let's get right into it.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
STRUCTURE (follow this exactly):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

[COLD OPEN — 15–30 seconds]
- HOST greets Tyler by name.
- One sentence on what today's episode covers (the "headline of headlines").
- COHOST reacts and weaves in the Austin weather naturally (not as a weather report — more like what a friend would say: "it's looking like a scorcher out there" or "grab a jacket this morning").

[THEME SEGMENTS — 3 to 6 segments, each ~1–2 minutes]
Cluster today's news into 3–6 named themes. Choose theme names that fit the actual news.
Good examples: "Databricks Product & Platform", "Lakehouse Ecosystem & Partners",
"LLM & Agent Breakthroughs", "Regulation & Policy", "Startup & Funding Moves",
"Open Source & Research". Discard low-signal or redundant items — not everything needs coverage.

For each theme segment:
- HOST introduces the theme with a punchy framing sentence, then delivers the core story.
- COHOST jumps in with reactions, follow-up questions, counterpoints, or "why it matters" color.
- Together they explain what happened, why it matters, and who it impacts (call out data engineers,
  ML practitioners, founders, or infra teams specifically when relevant).
- Where relevant, connect Databricks-specific news to the broader AI landscape.
- Add light, confident commentary — both hosts have opinions. Examples of the right tone:
  "This puts real pressure on Snowflake's AI roadmap."
  "Honestly, this is great news for early-stage teams with lean data stacks."
  "I think this is being undersold — here's why it matters."
- Use first-person ("I think", "what I find interesting here is", "we've been watching this").
- Address Tyler by name once or twice across the whole episode — not every segment.
- Transitions between segments should feel natural, not formulaic.

[WRAP-UP — 15–30 seconds]
- HOST gives a quick recap of the 1–2 biggest themes.
- COHOST adds what Tyler should keep an eye on over the coming days.
- Both sign off warmly and personally.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
STYLE RULES:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
- Write for the ear, not the eye. Short sentences. Active voice. No bullet points, no URLs, no markdown in the script.
- Conversational and smart — like two well-informed colleagues riffing on the news.
- The banter should feel natural, not forced. Don't overdo the back-and-forth — let each host make substantive points.
- Do NOT pad with filler. If today is a slow news day, say so honestly and go deeper on fewer items.
- Target word count: 1,200–1,800 words (8–12 minutes at a natural speaking pace).
- The ONLY bracketed labels allowed are [HOST] and [COHOST] at the start of each speaker turn.
  No other stage directions, segment headers, or bracketed labels.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
RAW CONTENT:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
${JSON.stringify(contentBundle, null, 2)}

Return ONLY the two-speaker script with [HOST] and [COHOST] tags. No other labels, headers, stage directions, or markdown.
