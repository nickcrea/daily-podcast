      "summary": "# Episode Summary\n\nThis episode covers three major developments in enterprise AI: Anthropic's acquisition of Vercept to integrate computer-use agents into Claude, paired with the release of their Responsible Scaling Policy v3 to govern these increasingly capable systems safely; Nvidia's record quarterly results reflecting sustained hyperscaler demand for AI infrastructure; and Databricks' push toward AI-native data engineering through new tools like Agent Bricks and Lakeflow, plus adaptive governance solutions for EU regulatory compliance. The broader narrative threads together how agentic AI is moving from concept to production, the infrastructure powering it, and the data engineering layer that makes it operationally viable.",

      "summary": "# Episode Summary\n\nThis episode covers three major developments reshaping AI and data infrastructure: Anthropic's upgraded Responsible Scaling Policy (version 3) introduces stricter safety thresholds and distillation attack detection, signaling serious commitment to AI governance amid industry skepticism. Databricks launches Zerobus Ingest for real-time data pipelines and pushes toward fully declarative data engineering, addressing the operational complexity that's kept many organizations stuck between pilots and production. The broader theme emerging across both stories is that AI and data infrastructure are finally moving beyond experimental projects into genuine operational capability—but only for organizations that can combine robust safety practices with reliable, governed data systems.",
