      "summary": "# Episode Summary\n\nThis episode covers three major developments reshaping AI and data infrastructure: Anthropic's upgraded Responsible Scaling Policy (version 3) introduces stricter safety thresholds and distillation attack detection, signaling serious commitment to AI governance amid industry skepticism. Databricks launches Zerobus Ingest for real-time data pipelines and pushes toward fully declarative data engineering, addressing the operational complexity that's kept many organizations stuck between pilots and production. The broader theme emerging across both stories is that AI and data infrastructure are finally moving beyond experimental projects into genuine operational capability—but only for organizations that can combine robust safety practices with reliable, governed data systems.",
