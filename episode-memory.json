      "summary": "# Episode Summary\n\nThis episode covers three major tech stories: Anthropic's high-stakes standoff with the Pentagon over AI safety guardrails, with a Friday deadline looming that could reshape how defense contractors approach AI policy; Databricks' push toward real-time data ingestion and fully declarative pipelines as the future of data engineering; and MatX's ambitious $500 million funding round to challenge Nvidia's dominance in AI chips with hardware built by former Google TPU engineers. The broader theme is how safety commitments, infrastructure choices, and competitive dynamics are reshaping AI's operational foundation.",
