      <title>The Data &amp; AI Daily — 2026-02-26</title>
      <description># Episode Summary

This episode covers three major developments in enterprise AI: Anthropic&apos;s acquisition of Vercept to integrate computer-use agents into Claude, paired with the release of their Responsible Scaling Policy v3 to govern these increasingly capable systems safely; Nvidia&apos;s record quarterly results reflecting sustained hyperscaler demand for AI infrastructure; and Databricks&apos; push toward AI-native data engineering through new tools like Agent Bricks and Lakeflow, plus adaptive governance solutions for EU regulatory compliance. The broader narrative threads together how agentic AI is moving from concept to production, the infrastructure powering it, and the data engineering layer that makes it operationally viable.</description>

      <title>The Data &amp; AI Daily — 2026-02-25</title>
      <description># Episode Summary

This episode covers three major developments reshaping AI and data infrastructure: Anthropic&apos;s upgraded Responsible Scaling Policy (version 3) introduces stricter safety thresholds and distillation attack detection, signaling serious commitment to AI governance amid industry skepticism. Databricks launches Zerobus Ingest for real-time data pipelines and pushes toward fully declarative data engineering, addressing the operational complexity that&apos;s kept many organizations stuck between pilots and production. The broader theme emerging across both stories is that AI and data infrastructure are finally moving beyond experimental projects into genuine operational capability—but only for organizations that can combine robust safety practices with reliable, governed data systems.</description>

      <description># Episode Summary

This episode covers three major tech stories: Anthropic&apos;s high-stakes standoff with the Pentagon over AI safety guardrails, with a Friday deadline looming that could reshape how defense contractors approach AI policy; Databricks&apos; push toward real-time data ingestion and fully declarative pipelines as the future of data engineering; and MatX&apos;s ambitious $500 million funding round to challenge Nvidia&apos;s dominance in AI chips with hardware built by former Google TPU engineers. The broader theme is how safety commitments, infrastructure choices, and competitive dynamics are reshaping AI&apos;s operational foundation.</description>

      <description># Episode Summary

This episode covers three major developments shaping the AI landscape: **Databricks&apos; aggressive push into real-time data infrastructure** with the general availability of Zerobus Ingest and a new declarative pipeline framework that could fundamentally reshape how data engineers build systems, **an intensifying standoff between Anthropic and the Pentagon** over AI safety guardrails with a Friday deadline looming, and **MatX&apos;s massive $500M funding round** from former Google TPU engineers positioning themselves as a serious challenger to Nvidia&apos;s AI chip dominance. The episode also touches on new model releases from Google and Anthropic, plus emerging concerns about the tension between safety commitments and government partnerships in the</description>
